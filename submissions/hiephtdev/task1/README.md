# Validator Introduction

## About Me

Hello, my name is HiepHT, and I have been actively involved in running validator nodes for various blockchain networks. My experience spans across multiple projects where I have contributed to the decentralization and security of their ecosystems.

## Networks I Validate

I am currently running validator nodes in the following networks:

- **Allora**: As a contributor to the Allora network, I help maintain worker nodes and support testnet operations
- **Avail goldberg testnet**: I run a full node for Avail, actively involved in maintaining system services for a stable validator setup. This includes configurations for the Goldberg testnet and participation in network telemetry.
- **Nubit**: I manage light nodes for Nubit, focusing on maintaining a lightweight node infrastructure and contributing scripts for automated service setup
- **[chainbase](https://holesky.eigenlayer.xyz/operator/0xA974340FAf9762a449Ac68c7A998Cfbf49272185)**
- **...**

These networks have allowed me to deepen my expertise in node operation and blockchain validation, ensuring network reliability and performance.

## Contributions

Throughout my journey, I have actively contributed by:

- Ensuring uptime and smooth operation of validator nodes.
- Providing feedback to developers and communities for network improvements.
- Participating in testnets and mainnets to enhance the stability and security of various blockchain projects.

I am passionate about blockchain technology and strive to contribute toward building secure and decentralized networks.

### Web3 and Web2 Development

In addition to my work as a validator, I am an experienced developer in both Web3 and Web2 spaces. My Web3 expertise includes smart contract development, decentralized application (dApp) architecture, and blockchain infrastructure. On the Web2 side, I have built full-stack applications using modern frameworks, ensuring secure, scalable solutions. My GitHub repositories showcase my contributions to open-source projects and development tools that span both domains.
